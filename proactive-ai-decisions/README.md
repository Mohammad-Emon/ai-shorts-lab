2. It sends the data to OpenRouter's API, which routes to your chosen AI model (default: GPT-3.5-turbo)
3. The AI identifies the most impactful actions to achieve your goal
4. Results are ranked by priority (impact/effort ratio)
5. Rate limits and usage are automatically handled by OpenRouter

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- For production use, consider upgrading to a paid plan for higher rate limits
- The quality of recommendations depends on the chosen model and your input data quality
